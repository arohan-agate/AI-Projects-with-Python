The purpose of this project is to train a simple deep learning model to analyze data and make a conclusion on whether or not an Instagram account was fake. Ideally, the model should distinguish fake and real accounts as accurately as possible. The model has performed successfully when it can identify the identity of a positive or negative instance of the true class. The model is unsuccessful when its prediction does not match the identity of the instance of the true class.
