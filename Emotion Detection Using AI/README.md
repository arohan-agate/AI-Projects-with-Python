The purpose of this project is to create a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and Residual Blocks to predict facial key points. Facial Key-Point Detection is the underlying basis for emotion detection using AI. 

The dataset used for this project is made of x and y coordinates of 15 facial key points. The images are 96p x 96p.
