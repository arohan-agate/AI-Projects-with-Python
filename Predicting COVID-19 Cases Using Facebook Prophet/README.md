The purpose of this project is to forecast COVID-19 cases in the United States using Facebook Prophet. Facebook Prophet can be used to forecast non-linear trends over a period of time, taking seasonality into account.

Prophet works best with a thourough amount of data, collected over a long period of time. This limitation is the reason to why the predicted data was not extremely accurate. Despite this, Prophet is powerful software, which is why the predicted data was fairly accurate.
